# Lunch and Learn
This bot makes it easy to create a lunch-and-learn event and watch cool tech talks together! At Sum Up we gather every Tuesday, order food and discover new topics presented at tech conferences all around the world. Feel free to utilize this little bot to your needs!

## Set Up
Make sure you provide Slack API Token in the `./slack_token.rb`   

Example:      
```
$slack_token = 'xoxb-111111111111-kajhdflakjsdhfuaewgflASJKHDGqwkjeh'
```

then specify your target channel in `main.rb` and run the bot like:    

```
ruby main.rb
```

And you are ready to go!
